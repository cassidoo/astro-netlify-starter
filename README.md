[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9e561573-ed5f-4ef9-86d1-e098fa22429f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/astro-netlify/deploys)

This is an Astro (v0.20.11) starter project based on the [Astro Starter Kit](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/tree/main/examples/starter), with a `netlify.toml` configuration included, and an example React component + CSS Module.

If you'd like to learn more about how Astro works, [here's an introductory blog post](https://dev.to/cassidoo/build-wicked-fast-sites-with-astro-an-introduction-173j)!

## Clone and Deploy

You can instantly clone this to your GitHub and deploy it by clicking this button here:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cassidoo/astro-netlify-starter)

Or, if you'd like to just use the CLI and not deploy just yet, you can use `create-astro` with this as a template:

```bash
npm init astro my-new-project --template cassidoo/astro-netlify-starter
```

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
